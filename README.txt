2.6 SAS LABORATORY
Two main approaches are considered in what follows. On the one hand, GLM scorecard development is
investigated. On the other hand, our focus is on machine learning. An overview of SAS implementation
is provided by focusing on the main steps of the modelling workflow. Details explored in the previous
sections by means of R can easily be replicated in SAS. In all cases, the same data scrutinised in
previous sections constitute our reference for SAS implementation.
SAS laboratory 2.6.1 focuses on GLM.
SAS laboratory 2.6.2 provides some hints on machine learning implementation. In more detail,
the focus is on both CART and random forest examples investigated throughout the chapter. Other
procedures can easily be derived as an enrichment process of the code already provided.
